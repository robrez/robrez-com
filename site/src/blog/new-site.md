# My new personal website

_This post is a work-in-progress_

I'm release a new personal website and would like to share some details regarding the effort

Many years ago I published a personal website which we built with [Polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/). I still have the source floating around [here](https://github.com/robrez/robrez-com-polymer).

It's about time for a shiny new website. Like the previous version, the new effort will be a combination of web-components and static content. Instead of fetching `markdown` files and rendering them via js, I thought this would be a good opportunity to try out [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).
