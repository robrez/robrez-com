Designed and implemented the organization’s FHIR resource server platform and secure API gateway enabling standards-based clinical interoperability. Established the architecture for on-premise resource servers fronted by a centralized gateway, integrated with the authorization platform for token-based access control. The platform achieved ONC Health IT Certification and became foundational infrastructure for internal modernization and third-party integrations, including patient-facing and external ecosystem applications.
