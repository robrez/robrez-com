Establish patterns for "MicroService" and "MicroFrontend" architecture and scale these patterns to other teams

Various "MicroFrontend" features developed in the form of web-components intended for re-use in any framework or dom environment. This is done via modern web standards, techniques and technologies such as: [Lit](https://lit.dev/) (element, html), TypeScript, [Context Protocol](https://github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/blob/main/proposals/context.md), [Scoped Custom Element Registries](https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.md), [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)

Analyzed UI/UX specifications to engineer design-system tokens and components which serve as building-blocks for features. Assist other teams and team members with their own features and integrations
