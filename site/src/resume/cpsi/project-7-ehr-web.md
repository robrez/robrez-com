Designed and built a modern web-based application platform to replace a proprietary thin-client runtime and markup ecosystem. Created an architecture that interfaces with existing service tiers and protocols while enabling incremental replacement of legacy applications with standards-based web implementations. This platform fundamentally expanded the organization’s technology palette, unblocked modern UI/UX capabilities, and established a controlled migration path away from a closed, proprietary application environment.
