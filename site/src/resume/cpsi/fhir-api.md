Created [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/) API resource server. Enhanced authorization infrastructure to support extended workflows specified by [SMART](http://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/index.html).

This product was certified to meet or exceed requirements of ONC's Health IT Certification Program. Most modern features in our ecosystem depend on this infrastructure. Additionally, third-party products such as [Apple Healthkit](https://www.apple.com/healthcare/health-records/) can be built on these standards-based protocols and services. ([Press release](https://www.cpsi.com/resources/news/health-records-on-iphone-now-available-to-cpsi-clients-and-the-communities-they-serve/))

Created and deployed a documentation website, as required for listing on the Certified Health IT Products List ([CHPL](https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certified-health-it-products-list-chpl))
