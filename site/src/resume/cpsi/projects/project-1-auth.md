Designed and built the organization's core authorization platform supporting OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SMART-on-FHIR workflows. Created the token, scope, key management, and administrative infrastructure underpinning secure access to all modern services. Recently evolved the platform to support enterprise identity federation via Keycloak, enabling customers to integrate preferred identity providers (Entra ID, Google, Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) and removing the requirement for EHR-native credentials. This work redefined authentication boundaries and established deep integration between the platform and customer IT ecosystems.
