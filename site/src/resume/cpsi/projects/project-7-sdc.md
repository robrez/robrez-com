Designed and built a structured data capture and extraction platform based on HL7 FHIR SDC principles, enabling presentation of standard and custom questionnaires and transformation of generalized form data into idiomatic FHIR resources. Designed an adapter layer allowing a legacy clinical documentation system to participate in SDC-based extraction workflows, extending structured capture, reporting, and interoperability capabilities without disrupting existing documentation platforms.
