Created Clinical Quality Measures application which was certified by ONC's Health IT Certification Program

Products in this space must evaluate numerous data points as required by a "Quality Measure" specification to determine whether a given patient falls into particular strata. This information must be packaged in both detailed and aggregated forms as mandated by the CDA-based [QRDA](https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qrda) Category I and Category III specifications.
