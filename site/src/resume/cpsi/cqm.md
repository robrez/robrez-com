Created Clinical Quality Measures application which was certified to meet or exceed requirements mandated by ONC's Health IT Certification Program. The purpose of this initiative is to improve healthcare outcomes for patients.

Applications in this space must evaluate numerous data points as specified by a "Quality Measure" specification to determine whether a given patient falls into particular strata. This information must be packaged in both detailed and aggregated forms as mandated by the CDA-based [QRDA](https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qrda) Category I and Category III specifications.
