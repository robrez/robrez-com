Built a structured data capture and extraction platform aligned with HL7 FHIR SDC, enabling presentation of standard and custom questionnaires and transformation of generalized form data into idiomatic FHIR resources. Designed an adapter layer allowing a legacy clinical documentation system to participate in SDC-based extraction workflows, extending structured capture, reporting, and interoperability capabilities without disrupting existing documentation platforms.
