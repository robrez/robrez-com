Created the organization's design system and UI component platform using standards-based web components and design tokens. Built branded component libraries atop Vaadin components, establishing reusable UI foundations that standardized visual language, accessibility, and interaction patterns across multiple applications. This platform enabled teams to build consistent features across heterogeneous technology stacks while preserving product identity.
