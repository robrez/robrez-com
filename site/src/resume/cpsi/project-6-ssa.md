Helped design and implement a shared service and application platform enabling isolated product-line slices with dedicated backend-for-frontend services. Created a standards-based "miniapp" ecosystem using web components, allowing features to be developed once and embedded across multiple flagship applications and technology stacks. Established shared UI foundations, integration patterns, and service boundaries that enabled independent delivery without fragmenting the overall platform.
