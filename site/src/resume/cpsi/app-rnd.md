Worked on team responsible high-priority "skunk works" efforts. Here are some examples:

- Move company away from COBOL lock-in by migrating data out of proprietary COBOL files and into a RDBMS while still allowing decades of COBOL programs to function as-is
- Created data-access library for java: ORM, CRUD, Typesafe-SQL-building
- Created MVVM-patterned framework allowing developers to write java-based applications rendered by a proprietary thin client
- Created adhoc reporting application
- Created a daemon which transforms proprietary XML layouts into XSL:FO for creation of large PDFs
- Created views to simplify access to complex relational data
- Created rule-based security engine
- Created auditing infrastructure and applications
